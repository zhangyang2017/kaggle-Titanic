## Overview <a id="1"></a>
Ah the famous Titanic Kaggle competition. I honestly had a lot of fun working through this project, seriously. I got to try out a lot of algorithms, including `naive bayes`, `logistic regression`, `decision tree`, `KNN`, `random forest`, `SVM`, `XGBoost`, `soft voting classifier`. For me, `random forest` gave me the highest accuracy at predicting the test dataset (78%). 

Project duration: 2020/10/21 - 2020/10/23
